    "In any probabilistic framework we wish to maxmise the likelihood of observed data given the probability functions. However, unlike classification/ regression situations we need to modify the likelihood $f(t)$. Let us define the case where death, $d_i$ hasn't been observed as censored observations. In those case we know that death will occur at a point $T > t$. Therefore the likelihood $L$ can be defined as:\n",
